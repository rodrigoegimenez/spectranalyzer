# SpectrAnalyzer - Deconvolute (and analyze) fluorescence spectra

SpectrAnalyzer is a library (and a web application) that helps deconvolute fluorescence spectra using different solving criteria.

## Getting Started
### Library
TODO: instructions on how to install and use the library.

### Webapp
The webapp can be currently accessed at the following url: https://deconvolute.me/

## What is implemented
Currently the only module working is for the deconvolution of the components of Laurdan 
fluorophore embedded in lipid membranes using the method described in 
[Bacalum et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2013.05.031).

There is ongoing work to implement the deconvolution of Merocyanin 540 and future work will involve
the deconvolution of Tryptophan fluorescent moieties in proteins.
